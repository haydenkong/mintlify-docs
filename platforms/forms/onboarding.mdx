  **TLDR:**

  \
  PixelVerse Forms is already set up for you! From now on, when a visitor submits the contact form on your website, both you and the visitor will get a email with the submission details. From then on, it acts like an regular email chain. You can respond to the confirmation email to reply to the visitor.\
  No additional cost is required, as you are an existing PixelVerseIT client :)

## About PixelVerse Forms

PixelVerse Forms is a robust form system built by us with a focus for contact forms on websites. 64% of visitors want to see contact information on the homepage, and 44% will leave if they cannot find it. Modern day websites, especially no-code website builders like Wix or Squarespace incorporate forms and notifications emails.

However, PixelVerse Forms is built from the ground up to remove any friction from communication from the guest who submits the form and the site owner/support personnel.

## How it works

PixelVerse Forms is already set up for you!

Here’s what happens:

1. When a visitor submits your contact form, **both you and the visitor receive a confirmation email** with all the submission details.
2. To respond, simply **reply directly to the confirmation email you receive**.
3. The system is two-way - meaning the visitor can reply back, and their response goes straight to you without requiring a dashboard, extra logins, or unnecessary steps.

This ensures smooth, direct communication with your website visitors, just like email, but with the simplicity of a contact form.

## PixelVerse Forms - Dashboard & No-codeReq

PixelVerse Forms also comes with a **no-code embed feature**, making it easy to add forms to any website without touching code.

In addition, PixelVerse Forms is a growing platform with a **dashboard and integrated** to view responses and form stats. While the dashboard UI is currently in beta, it’s not required for day-to-day use. The system was designed so that you can fully manage replies and communication straight from your email - meaning you don’t need to learn or log into a separate dashboard to respond to visitors.

## Spam with PixelVerse Forms

PixelVerse Forms includes built-in **anti-spam protection** to keep your inbox clean and your communication focused.

We reduce spam by using **honeypot fields**. These are invisible fields added to your form that normal visitors never see. Spam bots, however, usually fill out every field they detect - which instantly flags the submission as spam and blocks it.

This way, your inbox stays clear of unwanted messages without adding extra friction for real visitors.

<Info>
  We don’t send confirmation emails (both to you and the “visitor”/bot) to submissions marked as spam. However, all spam submissions are marked and can be viewed in the PixelVerse Forms dashboard.

  Real humans will never fill in honeypot fields, as they are hidden and invisible in the page.
